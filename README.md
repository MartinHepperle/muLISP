Files related to the muLISP programming language.

muLISP was a LISP variant which had been developed by Soft Warehouse in Hawaii in 1977.
Early versions were commercially available since 1979 for CP/M (8080,Z80), Apple II (native 6502/ADIOS as well as for the Z80 card), TRS-80 (Z80) and other Z80-based systems.

In 1981 the rewritten code became available for the Intel 808x processor family and the MS-DOS operating system.
The final version that was sold as a product was muLISP-90 (version 7.20, published in 1990).

Since 1980 it was also licensed and distributed by Microsoft under the name "Microsoft LISP".

muLISP was intially developed for writing Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like muMath (1979) and Derive (1988).
Derive for MS-DOS and MS-Windows had been very popular in the educational field.
Derive was  taken over by Texas Instruments (TI) in 1999 for re-implementation in their pocket calculators (starting with the TI-92).
TI ended the development of Derive for Windows in 2007. The last version was 6.10 for Windows 98, XP, 2000, written in muLISP for Derive, version 7.45 (which was not a product in itself).
