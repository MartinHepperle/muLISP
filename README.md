Files related to the muLISP programming language.

muLISP was a LISP variant which had been developed by Soft Warehouse in Hawaii.
Initial versions were for CP/M, Apple II, TRS-80 and other Z80-based systems.
Later the code was rewritten for the Intel 8086 processor and the MS-DOS operating system.
The final version was muLISP-90.

It was also distributed by Microsoft as Microsoft LISP.

muLISP was used to write the Computer Algebra System (CAS) Derive, which was finally taken over by Texas Instruments for re-implemantation in their pocket calculators.
